<h2 class="h2_heavy">Know What You Need to Graduate</h2>

<p>Follow the steps below to identify what requirements you need to complete your degree.</p>

<div class="accordion">
<div>
<h4>Step # 1: Run&nbsp;your Degree Progress Report</h4>
</div>

<div>
<h2><strong>Your Degree Progress Report</strong></h2>

<p><strong class="emphBlue">Your Degree Progress Report (also known as your DPR) is the most important tool to understand as a Cal Poly student.</strong> Like the Curriculum Sheet, the Degree Progress Report displays all of your degree requirements to graduate.&nbsp;The Evaluations Unit uses the Degree Progress Report to post your degree so it is important to make sure the courses you have and will be taking are fulfilling the requirements you expected in your DPR.</p>

<p><strong class="emphRed">Your DPR should be ran at least once per quarter to track your progress to degree.</strong></p>

<hr />
<p><strong>How to access your <a href="https://registrar.calpoly.edu/degree-progress-report-guide" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Degree Progress Report</a></strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>Log in to your <strong>My Cal Poly Portal</strong> at&nbsp;my.calpoly.edu</li>
	<li>Go to your <strong>Student Center&nbsp;</strong>under My Apps</li>
	<li>Click on&nbsp;<strong>Academic Progress </strong>drop down</li>
	<li>Click on <strong>Degree Progress Report</strong></li>

<p><strong>How to read your <a href="https://registrar.calpoly.edu/degree-progress-report-guide" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Degree Progress Report</a></strong></p>

<p>Scrolling through the Degree Progress Report can be a little confusing. It can be helpful to look at the Degree Progress Report with your Curriculum Sheet in hand as it is broken up into sections similarly to your Curriculum Sheet.</p>

<p>You can view your Degree Progress Report through the PDF or online.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>It can be helpful to review the <a href="https://registrar.calpoly.edu/degree-progress-report-guide">Degree Progress Report Guide</a>.</p>

<div class="accordion">
<div>
<h4>Step # 2: Identify the Status of your Degree Requirements</h4>
</div>

<div>
<h2><strong>Your Degree Requirements</strong></h2>

<p>Everything you need to complete for your degree is in your Degree Progress Report. It is important to review it often, especially after registration.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Identify Status of&nbsp;Your Degree Requirements</strong></p>

<p>To earn your degree, every requirement in your Degree Progress Report must be completed. Satisfied Requirements are&nbsp;indicated with a Green&nbsp;"Satisfied" icon or green check mark, depending on how you are viewing your DPR.</p>

<p>The goal is to see the green icon below across your entire DPR before you graduate.</p>

<p><img alt="Satisfied Icon in Online DPR" height="31" src="https://content-calpoly-edu.s3.amazonaws.com/eadvise/1/images/satisfied.png" width="100" /><img alt="Satisfied in PDF DPR" height="33" src="https://content-calpoly-edu.s3.amazonaws.com/eadvise/1/images/green%20satisfied%20check.png" width="40" /></p>

<p>It is important to have a plan for the items that are marked&nbsp;as In Progress or Not Satisfied. These items are indicated by the following icons:</p>

<p><strong>In Progress</strong></p>

<p><img alt="In Progress in Online DPR" height="29" src="https://content-calpoly-edu.s3.amazonaws.com/eadvise/1/images/satisfied%20IP.png" width="100" /><img alt="In Progress in PDF DPR" height="38" src="https://content-calpoly-edu.s3.amazonaws.com/eadvise/1/images/In%20progress%20diamond.png" width="40" /></p>

<p><strong>Not Satisfied</strong></p>

<p><img alt="Not Satisfied in Online DPR" height="26" src="https://content-calpoly-edu.s3.amazonaws.com/eadvise/1/images/not%20satisfied%20.png" width="100" /><img alt="Not Satisfied in PDF DPR" height="43" src="https://content-calpoly-edu.s3.amazonaws.com/eadvise/1/images/Not%20satisfied%20box.png" width="40" /></p>

<p>As your scroll through your DPR, make a list of all of the requirements that are In Progress and Not Satisfied.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="accordion">
<div>
<h4>Step # 3: Make a Plan for your Unmet Requirements</h4>
</div>

<div>
<h2>Have a Plan</h2>

<p>If your goal is to graduate by or before Spring 2026, it is important to have a plan. If you need help with making a graduation plan, we encourage you to <a href="https://calendly.com/cobadvis">meet with&nbsp;an advisor</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Further Understand Your Degree Requirements</h2>

<p>It is important you&nbsp;know what you need to earn your degree. The resources below can be helpful to gain a deeper understanding of your degree requirements.</p>

<div class="accordion">
<div>
<h4>Know Your Catalog</h4>
</div>

<div>
<p>Every student&nbsp;at Cal Poly is on&nbsp;specific Catalog (2022-2026, 2021-2022, etc.), which outlines the official curricula and courses, academic policies, and information needed to earn a degree. Requirements&nbsp;for degree programs may change from one catalog to the next.</p>

<p>In order to understand what you need to graduate, you must also know what Catalog you are on. You can verify your Catalog by following the steps below:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Log in to your <strong>My Cal Poly Portal</strong> at&nbsp;my.calpoly.edu</li>
	<li>Go to your <strong>Academics</strong> tab</li>
	<li>Under <strong>Degree Information</strong> view your Catalog Year
	<ul>
		<li>The example below shows that this student is on the 2022-2026 Catalog</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<h4>Understand your Curriculum Sheet</h4>

<p>Support courses are courses chosen by your department to provide foundational support for your Major Courses. In the College of Business, these courses sometimes double count as General Education Courses.</p>

<p><strong><img alt="" height="31" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/da4kgk4uw/image/upload/v1747162477/Screenshot_2025-05-13_at_11.54.33_AM_gci4et.png" width="25" />General Education (GE) Courses</strong></p>

<p>General Education Courses are broken down into several areas. You may notice some of these areas are completed through your Support Courses.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Graduate Writing Requirement (GWR) &amp; United States Cultural Pluralism Requirement (USCP)</h4>
</div>

<div>
<p>There are two requirements that are important for you to know about. You will want to review both requirements and plan ahead so you are not adding extra work while completing your degree.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Graduation Writing Requirement (GWR)</strong></p>

<p>The Graduation Writing Requirement (GWR) is a CSU-mandated program designed to ensure that student can write proficiently before they enter the professional workforce. All Cal Poly students who are seeking a degree must fulfill the GWR before a diploma can be awarded.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Undergraduate students</strong>&nbsp;with 90 or more completed units should attempt to fulfill the&nbsp;GWR before their senior year.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>There are two ways to fulfill the GWR:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>Pass a&nbsp;<a href="https://writingandlearning.calpoly.edu/gwr-designated-courses" target="_blank">GWR-certified&nbsp;upper-division course</a>&nbsp;with a C or better on a major writing assignment and a final course grade of C or better with at least 35% of the final grade based on the cumulative grade of all writing projects; OR,</li>
	<li>Earn a passing score on a&nbsp;<a href="https://writingandlearning.calpoly.edu/gwrportfolio" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">GWR Portfolio</a>&nbsp;</li>

<div class="accordion">
<div>
<h4>What if I want to walk in the Spring Commencement ceremony, but don't have all my degree requirements fulfilled?</h4>
</div>

<div>
<p>First, it is important to know that walking in the Commencement Ceremony does not mean you have officially earned your degree. You may request to walk in the Commencement Ceremony prior to having your degree requirements fulfilled.</p>
